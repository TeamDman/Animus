      "text": "The Ritual of Siphon (Fluid Pump) is a powerful fluid extraction ritual that automatically pumps fluid source blocks from below the Master Ritual Stone and places them into a tank above. This ritual is the inverse of Relentless Tides, perfect for draining lakes, oceans, or lava pools."

      "title": "How It Works",
      "text": "The ritual requires a fluid tank (any block with fluid storage capability) placed directly above the Master Ritual Stone. Every 0.5 seconds, the ritual attempts to:$(br)1. Find a fluid source block below the ritual stone$(br)2. Extract the fluid from the world$(br)3. Fill the tank with 1 bucket (1000mB) of fluid$(br)4. Consume LP for the operation"

      "title": "Search Algorithm",
      "text": "The ritual uses a center-outward search to find fluid sources:$(br)- Starts directly below the Master Ritual Stone$(br)- Expands in square rings: 0, 1, 2... blocks away$(br)- Searches each column vertically (top to bottom)$(br)- Prioritizes nearby fluids before distant ones$(br)- Only extracts source blocks, not flowing fluids$(br)- Processes up to 64 positions per tick$(br)- Resumes where it left off between ticks$(br2)This ensures efficient extraction starting from the center."

      "text": "If the ritual cannot extract fluid (no fluid, tank full, or conflicting fluid type):$(br)- Smoke particles will emit from the MRS as a warning$(br)- No fluid is removed from the world$(br)- No LP is consumed$(br2)The smoke indicates:$(br)• No tank present above the MRS$(br)• Tank is full$(br)• Tank doesn't accept this fluid type$(br)• No fluid sources found in range"

At default settings, costs 50 LP per bucket extracted.$(br2)Pro tip: Pair with Relentless Tides to move fluids from one location to another! Place Siphon to drain, Relentless Tides to fill."
