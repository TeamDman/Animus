It will drain up to 100 will total per cycle, consuming proportionally from all available will types based on their relative abundance.$(br2)The more varied the types of will present, the more efficient the conversion becomes; each additional will type beyond the first grants a 10% mana bonus."

Pair it with Blood Magic's demon will systems and Botania's mana distribution network for a self-sustaining hybrid setup.$(br2)When consuming will, the fungi produces a distinctive slurping sound and releases ghostly soul fire flames that rise upward; making it easy to identify active specimens."
