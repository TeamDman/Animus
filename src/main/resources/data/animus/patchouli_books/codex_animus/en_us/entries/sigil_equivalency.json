      "text": "The sigil operates on a selection-based system:$(br)• Sneak + right-click blocks to add them to your selection (up to 20 types)$(br)• Sneak + right-click air to clear your selection$(br)• Right-click a block to replace all matching blocks in radius with randomly chosen selections"

The sigil remembers your selection$(br)4. Right-click any block to replace all instances of that block type in the radius$(br2)The sigil will only use blocks from your selection that are currently in your inventory."

      "text": "When activated on a block:$(br)• Scans in a spiral pattern from the center outward$(br)• Finds all matching blocks up to the configured radius (default: 32 blocks)$(br)• Extracts each block with Silk Touch$(br)• Places a randomly selected replacement block from your selection$(br)• Processes blocks over multiple ticks to prevent lag$(br)• Consumes LP per block replaced (default: 100 LP per block)"

      "text": "The sigil provides clear visual and audio feedback:$(br)• Magical particles appear at each replaced block$(br)• Portal sounds play for each swap$(br)• Action bar messages keep you informed of progress$(br)• Tooltip shows how many block types are selected$(br2)The replacement happens gradually over time, so you can see your transformation unfold before your eyes!"

      "type": "patchouli:text",
      "title": "Configuration",
      "text": "Server admins can configure:$(br)• Maximum radius for block replacement (default: 32, max: 64)$(br)• LP cost per block (default: 100 LP)$(br)• Blocks processed per tick (default: 5)$(br2)Lower blocks per tick reduces lag but makes replacement slower. Perfect for balancing performance with large-scale transformations."

      "type": "patchouli:text",
      "title": "Usage Tips",
      "text": "Best practices:$(br)• Keep plenty of replacement blocks in your inventory$(br)• Select multiple block types for variety$(br)• Start small to test your selection before large operations$(br)• The sigil uses Silk Touch, so you get the original blocks back$(br)• Great for swapping stone types, changing wood varieties, or transforming entire biomes!$(br2)Example: Select oak, birch, and spruce logs, then click a jungle log to randomly replace all jungle logs in range."
