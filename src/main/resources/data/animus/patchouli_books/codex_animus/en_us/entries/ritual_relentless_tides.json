      "text": "The Ritual of Relentless Tides (Floodgate) is a powerful fluid manipulation ritual that extracts fluids from a tank placed directly above the Master Ritual Stone and places them in the world below. This ritual is ideal for automated fluid placement, terraforming, or creating large bodies of water or lava."

      "title": "How It Works",
      "text": "The ritual requires a fluid tank (any block with fluid storage capability) placed directly above the Master Ritual Stone. Every 0.5 seconds, the ritual attempts to:$(br)1. Extract 1 bucket (1000mB) of fluid from the tank$(br)2. Find a valid placement spot below the ritual stone$(br)3. Place the fluid as a source block$(br)4. Consume LP for the operation"

      "title": "Placement Algorithm",
      "text": "The ritual uses a center-outward search to find placement spots:$(br)- Starts directly below the Master Ritual Stone$(br)- Expands in square rings: 0, 1, 2... blocks away$(br)- Searches each column vertically (top to bottom)$(br)- Prioritizes placing near the center first$(br)- Can place in air, replaceable blocks, or flowing fluids$(br)- Won't replace existing source blocks of same fluid$(br)- Processes up to 64 positions per tick$(br)- Resumes where it left off between ticks"
    },
    {
      "type": "patchouli:text",
      "title": "No Valid Position",
      "text": "If the ritual cannot find a valid spot to place fluid (area is full or no tank):$(br)- Smoke particles will emit from the MRS as a warning$(br)- No fluid is extracted from the tank$(br)- No LP is consumed$(br2)This prevents wasting fluids and LP when the placement area is saturated or when setup is incomplete."

      "text": "The Ritual of Relentless Tides uses a water-themed pattern with 8 Water runes (representing fluid control and manipulation) and 4 Air runes (representing flow and movement). The pattern creates three concentric rings of power."

      "title": "Usage Tips",
      "text": "This ritual is excellent for:$(br)- Automated ocean/lake creation$(br)- Lava placement for mob farms$(br)- Controlled flooding for mining$(br)- Terraforming large areas$(br2)Works with any fluid tank: Blood Magic tanks, Tinkers' tanks, or modded fluid storage. At default settings, costs 50 LP per bucket placed.$(br2)The ritual doesn't care if there's solid ground below - it places fluids in mid-air and lets Minecraft's physics take over. Perfect for flooding from above!"
