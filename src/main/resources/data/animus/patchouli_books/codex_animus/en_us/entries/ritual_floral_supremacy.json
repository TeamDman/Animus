      "text": "The Ritual of Floral Supremacy is a powerful ritual that bridges Blood Magic and Botania, supercharging nearby mana-generating flowers and accelerating mana distribution. This ritual simulates the effect of Botania's enchanted soil (Overgrowth Seed) while also speeding up mana spreaders for maximum efficiency."

      "title": "How It Works",
      "text": "Every second, the ritual scans for Botania mana-generating flowers and mana spreaders within its radius:$(br2)$(blood)Flower Enhancement:$()$(br)Each flower is supercharged, doubling its tick rate as if it were placed on enchanted soil. This effectively doubles mana production.$(br2)$(animus)Spreader Acceleration:$()$(br)Each mana spreader receives 2x tick acceleration for 2 seconds, rapidly transferring mana to pools and devices."

      "title": "LP Consumption",
      "text": "The ritual consumes LP based on the number of flowers being enhanced:$(br2)$(blood)LP Cost:$() 50 LP per flower per second (configurable)$(br2)If you have 10 Endoflames in range, the ritual will consume 500 LP per second to supercharge them all. No flowers in range = no LP consumed.$(br2)The ritual only operates when there are flowers to enhance and you have sufficient LP."

The doubled production often makes the LP cost worthwhile for time-sensitive projects.$(br2)Pro tip: Pair with the Diabolical Fungi to convert demon will into mana at double speed!"
